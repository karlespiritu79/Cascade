<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A few years ago, a friend of mine dragged me into a dance lesson which included some ballroom styles as well as East Coast Swing.
	&nbsp; I had so much fun dancing that we decided to take some beginners swing lessons.&nbsp; I have always loved singing, 
	playing, and listening to swing music, so making me dance to it didn't take much convincing.&nbsp; If you are interested in Swing,
	the best place to learn and try it out is at the legion on Commercial Dr. (see <a href="#legion">poster</a> below).

<br />
<br />

There are many different types of swing.&nbsp; The ones
I know are East Coast (great for beginners and faster music) and Lindy Hop (more
difficult, but looks better).&nbsp; Lindy Hop is the current style I'm working
on and I hope to take more lessons and have more practice in the future.&nbsp;
Lindy Hop is named after Charles Lindberg who made his famous
trans-Atlantic flight to Paris from New York in 1927.

<h2>Music</h2>
<p>The music is definitely what makes the dance happen.
